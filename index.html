            Hello, I'm Kurogane Toyama. This is a website designed (poorly) for the
            purpose of teaching myself about websites. There 
            might not be anything of your interest, so don't put too much
            hope in it.
        </div>

        <div class = "intro">
            With that said, feel free to visit my website!
