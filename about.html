                Nice to meet you, visitors of this website. My name is Kurogane
                Toyama, a first-year student about to enter university. I have several
                hobbies such as coding, writing stories, and playing games (gacha games included). Though I'm not
                really excellent at any of them, I still enjoy doing them a lot. <br><br>

                While I appreciate being to learn things properly at university, it still
                suits me more to try to learn on my own. I suppose that's what
                allows me to discover the most about myself. So you may see this website
                as being poorly designed with a lot of messy lines of codes, but I sincerely
                enjoyed making this website, even if it's not up to my expectations. <br><br>

                I suppose all of this should sum up the basics of my character. Feel free to 
                explore this website, though I have to say there isn't much to it. <br><br>

                Also, I'm a weeb. A very experienced weeb.

            alt = "Kochiya Sanae">

            <div class = "intro2">
                As I mentioned earlier, I'm a weeb. As well as a Touhou fan. <br><br>

                This is my dearest girl, Kochiya Sanae. As for how I came to know and love her,
                well, that's a secret. <br><br>

                But I will tell you one thing. <br><br>

                No one can ever replace her in my heart. She's just that special.
