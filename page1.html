            Hello, hello. Welcome to Page 1. This is the page designed to teach
            myself about JavaScript (JS) in HTML as well as some other random stuff.
            Again, don't expect too much out of this.
            Here we go!
        </div>

        <div class = "content">
            Here, I'm trying to implement some very basic JS. 
            Try clicking on the button below. It should change the existing text beside
            to another text.
        </div>

        <button type = "button" onclick = "func1()">Click here</button>
        <p id = "demo">The Text</p>

        <div class = "content">
            If you saw the text changed, then it worked. Hooray! <br>
            Okay, I'll try something more complex. Try putting in a number.
            Please be a number. I'm still not good enough for conditionals.
        </div>

        <button type = "button" id = "res" onclick = "func2()">Click here</button>
        <input type = "number" id = "num">

        <div class = "content">
            Now click the button. If you see a number twice as large as
            the input appears, that's great! It means I got some progress.
